# Empathica

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a humanised chatbot targeting B2B interactions, leveraging Large Pretrained Language Models (LPU based LLMs) to enhance user experience. The chatbot integrates sentiment analysis, retrieval augmented generation, and a feedback mechanism, all orchestrated through a federal learning approach for decentralized global model generation.

## Features

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Methodology**: Integrating sentiment analysis into the chatbot pipeline to determine the sentiment of user messages.
- **Interpretation**: Assigning sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral) to messages.
- **Response Strategies**:
  - Positive Sentiment: Respond enthusiastically and affirmatively.
  - Negative Sentiment: Express empathy and offer support or solutions.
  - Neutral Sentiment: Respond neutrally or informatively.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzing sentiment in the context of the conversation for better accuracy.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation
- **Methodology**: Utilizing retrieval augmented generation for context-based query responses. This technique combines the advantages of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and generate responses accordingly.
- **Advantages**: Enables the chatbot to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **Implementation**: Incorporating a knowledge base and retrieval mechanism to support the chatbot in retrieving and generating responses based on user queries.

### Enhancing User Experience
- **Anthropomorphic Visual Cues**: Implementing visual cues for a human-like effect to enhance social presence and perceived homophily.
- **Benefits**:
  - Greater Social Presence: Leading to favorable attitudes and increased behavioral intentions to return to the website.
  - Perceived Homophily: Contributing to positive attitudes and increased return intentions.
- **Implementation**: Designing the chatbot interface with anthropomorphic visual cues such as avatars or emojis to foster a sense of human-like interaction.


### Feedback Mechanism
- **Real-Time Feedback Integration**: Allowing users to provide feedback on response relevance and quality in real-time.
- **Feedback Interpretation**: Analyzing feedback sentiment and categorizing it based on specific response aspects.
- **Dynamic Response Adjustment**: Using feedback to dynamically adjust response generation.
- **Relevance Ranking Optimization**: Incorporating feedback into the relevance ranking mechanism to prioritize relevant information retrieval.
- **Learning from User Interactions**: Employing machine learning algorithms to analyze feedback patterns and iteratively improve chatbot performance.
- **Implementation**: Integrating feedback buttons or text input within the chatbot interface for users to provide real-time feedback.



### Federal Learning
- **Approach**: Implementing federal learning for decentralized global model generation. This approach allows multiple distributed nodes to collaboratively train a global model while preserving data privacy and security.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Data Privacy**: Ensures that sensitive user data remains localized and is not shared across the network.
  - **Scalability**: Facilitates scalable model training by distributing computation across multiple nodes.
  - **Robustness**: Increases model robustness by aggregating knowledge from diverse data sources.
- **Implementation**: Configuring the chatbot architecture to incorporate federal learning methodologies for model training and updates.
